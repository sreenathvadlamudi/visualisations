  <!-- Add your D3.js visualization placeholders here -->
  <h3>Visualizations done using d3.js</h3>
  <div>
    <img src="img/bubblechart.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>
      The bubble chart visualizes the association between pay, location, and population. Each bubble represents a distinct data point, with the size corresponding to the population and the color representing salary range. This visualization allows for the observation of salary differences across various areas and population densities.
      
      Insights:
      
      High-density bubbles in specific regions indicate areas with a concentration of high-paying occupations and a dense population.
      Varying bubble sizes indicate salary disparities between areas, with larger bubbles signifying higher population density.
      </p>
    <img src="img/bargraph.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The bar graph visualization depicts a comparative examination of job title populations during 1980â€“2023. Visualizing the distribution of job titles across time allows us to see patterns in job attractiveness and shifts in workforce dynamics.

      Insights:
      
      Certain job titles had high population expansion, indicating rising demand or growing businesses.
      In contrast, several job categories had population declines, indicating changes in market demand or technology improvements affecting employment responsibilities.
      </p>
    <img src="img/heatmap.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The heat map visualization provides a detailed picture of wage distributions by job title and firm size. By color-coding wage ranges, this graphic allows for rapid insights into salary differences and patterns in the dataset.

      Insights:
      
      Heat map gradients show salary clusters within specific job titles and firm sizes, suggesting areas with high and low remuneration.
      Darker tones indicate greater wage ranges, while lighter shades reflect lower salary categories, making salary trends easy to identify.
      </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="python">Python Visualizations</h2>
  <!-- Add your Python visualization placeholders here -->
  <div id="python-viz">
    <div>
        <img src="img/pylineplot.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>The line plot visualizes population patterns over time. By graphing population statistics against time, we may examine demographic transitions and population growth patterns.</p>
        <img src="img/pyviolin.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>
          The violin plot visualizes the salary distribution across different expertise levels. Visualizing wage distributions within each experience group allows us to discover differences and trends in compensation structures.
          </p>
        <img src="img/scatter.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>The scatter plot visualizes the association between age and salary. Individual data points can be plotted depending on age and pay to detect connections and patterns between the two variables.</p>
        <img src="img/histogram.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>
          The histogram visualizes the distribution of population sizes in 2022. By plotting population data in a histogram, we can detect patterns and trends in population distribution across the dataset.
          
          </p>
    
      
  </div>

  <h2 id="tableau">Tableau Visualizations</h2>
  <!-- Add your Tableau visualization placeholders here -->
  <div>
    <img src="img/indx.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The colorful bar graph visualizes pay distributions across nations and experience levels. By visualizing wage data across countries and experience levels, we may uncover inequalities and trends in compensation structures.

      Insights:
      
      Bars of differing lengths reflect wage ranges for different nations and experience levels, allowing for comparisons and trend analysis.
      Discrepancies in bar heights reveal differences in income levels across nations and experience groups, providing insight into worldwide compensation patterns.
      </p>
    <img src="img/bblchart.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The colorful bubble chart illustrates the relationship between customers and gross amounts. Visualizing gross amounts in connection to customer transactions allows us to discover high-value consumers and transaction frequencies.

      Insights:
      
      Larger bubbles reflect consumers with higher transaction values, showing their importance in terms of revenue generating.
      Variable bubble colors and sizes allow for rapid detection of transaction patterns and client groupings based on gross amounts.
      </p>
    <img src="img/indx1.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>The colorful bar graph visualizes gross amounts over time for various consumers. By visualizing gross amounts over time for specific customers, we can track revenue patterns and client spending habits.

      Insights:
      
      Bar heights represent gross amounts for individual customers and years, enabling trend analysis and anomaly discovery.
      Color gradients show substantial changes over time, with darker colors signifying greater values and lighter shades denoting lower values.
      </p>
    <img src="img/map.png" alt="D3.js Visualization 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p>
      The colored map depiction displays countries according to their rankings and global percentages. By color-coding countries based on their rankings and percentages, we can learn about global distribution patterns and market shares.

Insights:

Countries with deeper hues have higher rankings and bigger world percentages, indicating their dominance in the worldwide market.
Lighter-colored countries have lower ranks and a smaller global share, indicating nascent markets or specialist sectors.
